# GSP # {#goods-services-provider}

A Solid Goods and/or Services Provider (GSP) is a object in a Solid storage which holds data 
about an entity that provides goods and/or services.

A Solid GSP is all built inside a single folder (LDP Container) in a Solid storage. 
Let us call the URI of that folder -- less its final '/' -- `$ROOT`. 
It could be say, *https://alice.example.org/myBusiness/*. Developers must never make assumptions 
about where a Solid GSP is stored as users should be able to choose the location they want.

The GSP object is defined in the `$ROOT/index` document. The RDF type of the GSP is `dfc-b:Enterprise`. 

<div id="example-gsp" class="example" heading="A GSP document in turtle">
    <pre class="include-code">
        path: ./examples/gsp.ttl
        highlight: turtle
    </pre>
</div>

Other properties can be defined like listed in the GSP shape below (TBD).

## Access rights ## {#enterprise-access-rights}

By default, the GSP container is private. When one wants to make the GSP public, private properties can still be defined in a separated private document, let's says `$ROOT/index-private`, linked with the public `$ROOT/index` document using the `rdfs:seeAlso` predicate.

## Discovery ## {#enterprise-discovery}

Type indexes is the recommended mechanism to discover Solid GSP. The RDF class to register an instance of a Solid GSP is `dfc-b:Enterprise`. Type indexes MUST only register the GSPs owned by the WebId owner. See [[!type-indexes]].

# Products and services # {#products-services}

Solid products are defined in [[!solid-goods-services]].

Supplied products are stored in the `$ROOT/supplied-products/` container.

#Â Catalogs # {#catalogs}

Supplied products are stored in the `$ROOT/catalogs/` container.

# Third parties # {#third-parties}

Supplied products are stored in the `$ROOT/third-parties/` container.

# Orders # {#order}

Supplied products are stored in the `$ROOT/orders/` container.
